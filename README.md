# Power-Bi-Dashboard-for-Reliance

Power BI Dashboard Project | Reliance Smart Enterprises (Sample Data)

Excited to share my recent work on a Power BI dashboard project designed to generate actionable insights for a retail enterprise. Here's a quick overview:

• Objective:
To build an interactive and visually insightful dashboard for Reliance Smart Enterprises that helps in better understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management.

• Data Source:
Utilized a sample dataset from Kaggle (Retail Sales/Inventory data) to simulate real-world scenarios and metrics relevant to a retail business environment.

• Tools & Tech Used:

Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

Excel for initial data exploration

DAX for building dynamic KPIs and calculated fields


• Key Features of the Dashboard:

Sales Overview: Monthly/quarterly revenue trends, region-wise performance

Top-Performing Products: Category and item-level profitability insights

Customer Insights: Repeat customer analysis, average transaction value

Inventory Management: Stock vs. sales tracking and supply-demand gaps

Interactive Filters: Time range, store location, product category, etc.


• Impact & Learning:
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of retail business KPIs, advanced DAX expressions, and storytelling with data. I also explored how a dashboard can support decision-making for marketing, sales, and supply chain teams.

• Next Steps:
Would love to take this further by applying similar dashboards to real-time datasets or integrating it with a live database/API.

Open to feedback or collaboration on similar data visualization or analytics projects!
